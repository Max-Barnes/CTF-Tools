# Bash Scripts for CTF Challenges

Welcome to the Bash Scripts for CTF Challenges repository! This collection of scripts is designed to help streamline and automate tasks commonly encountered during Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. I plan to use it to store tools and scripts I use while playing CTFS.

# ⚠️ Disclaimer

These scripts are for educational purposes only. Use them responsibly and only in environments where you have explicit permission. Unauthorized use of these scripts may violate laws and regulations. I am not responsible for what you do with these scripts.

Bash: These scripts are built for Bash and should work on most Linux systems.

Dependencies: Some scripts may rely on additional tools like nmap, curl, or grep. Ensure these are installed before running the scripts.

# Folders

enum/: Scripts for enumeration (e.g., port scanning, service discovery).

exploit/: Tools for exploitation (e.g., payload generation, vulnerability exploitation).

post-exploit/: Scripts for post-exploitation tasks (e.g., privilege escalation, data extraction).

encryption/: Scripts for decryption

misc/: General utility scripts for miscellaneous tasks.

Each folder has a docs.md file which will explain what each .sh script does and where I use them.
